# Segmentation-Scanner
Any time I have to run a segmentation scan by hand I get a big cringe. In an effort to reduce human error and increase automation I wrote this script.

Usage:
python segmentation-scanner.py -v <target_vlan> -t <target_ip_range>

When in doubt, you can always run it with the -h argument to get some more help.
